## How to run the tutorial

### Preferred: Pangeo Binder
Use the Pangeo Binder below to get the best performance for the tutorial (github account needed for login)

[![Binder](https://aws-uswest2-binder.pangeo.io/badge_logo.svg)](https://aws-uswest2-binder.pangeo.io/v2/gh/pangeo-data/pangeo-docker-images/2021.11.09?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fjbusecke%252Ftutorial_osm22_cmip6%26urlpath%3Dlab%252Ftree%252Ftutorial_osm22_cmip6%252Fgetting_started.ipynb%26branch%3Dmain)

> If you get an `User xxx already has a running server.` error, go to your [hub home](https://hub.aws-uswest2-binder.pangeo.io/hub/home) and click 'Stop My Server' and try again.

### Fallback: MyBinder
If the above method should not work for you, try the non-pangeo binder below. It has less resources, but does not require any login.
